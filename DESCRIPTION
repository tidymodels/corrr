Title: Correlations in R
Description: corrr is a package for exploring
  CORRelation matrices in R. It provides methods for
  doing routine tasks when exploring correlation
  matrices such as comparing only some variables
  against others, or arranging the matrix in terms of
  the strength of the correlations, and so it.
  It also provides visualisation methods for extracting
  useful information such as variable clustering
  and latent dimensionality.
