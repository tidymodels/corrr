# corrr (development version)

- Make `colpair_map()` more robust to input column names, with the exception of ".data" and ".env" (@jameslairdsmith, #131).

- `correlate()` now removes non-numeric columns from data frame inputs (@thisisdaryn, #139).
- `autoplot.cor_df()` method have been added fot quick generation of correlation chart.
- `network_plot()` now allows the user the option to map the color range to the range of correlations that are in the input `rdf` (@thisisdaryn, #158). 

# corrr 0.4.3

- Fix EOL issues and class attribute (@krlmlr, #93 and #90)

- Handle correlation of exactly zero or 1 in `network_plot()` (@s-scherrer, #89)

- Add `.order` argument to `rplot()` with options "default" and "alphabet" plus improved documentation (@mattwarkentin, #99 and @thisisdaryn, #114)

- Make `network_plot()` more robust, for example to highly correlated data (@thisisdaryn, #107)

- New `colpair_map()` allows for column comparisons using the values returned by an arbitrary function (@jameslairdsmith, #94).

- `correlate()` now works with single-column data.frames and numeric vectors (@antoine-sachet, #122). Note the `diagonal` argument is ignored in these 2 cases.
  
- `network_plot()` now works with `cor_df` objects with only 1 or 2 columns (@antoine-sachet, #122)

- The first column of a `cor_df` object is now named "term". Previously it was named "rowname" (@thisisdaryn, #117).

# corrr 0.4.2

# corrr 0.4.1

- Updates maintainer

# corrr 0.4.0

- Adds `remove.dups` argument to `stretch()`.  It removes duplicates with out removing all NAs (#57)

- Adds `dice()` function, wraps `focus(x,..., mirror = TRUE)` (#64)

- Adds `retract()` function, opposite of `stretch()` (#65)

- Improves `correlate()` for database backed tables

- Fixes compatibility issues with `dplyr` 

# corrr 0.3.2

- Improves support for `tbl_sql()` objects

- Switches correlation calculation for `tbl_spark()` tables to `sparklyr::ml_corr()`

- Adds package level doc (@jsta, #66)

- Fixes typo on error message (@jsta)

- Removes Database vignette. Plan to re-add later on (#76)

- Minor updates to Using corrr vignette

# corrr 0.3.1

- Fixes test and CRAN issues by removing `Ops.cor_df()`. 

- Designates Edgar Ruiz as the new package maintainer

# corrr 0.3.0

## Small breaking changes

The `diagonal` argument of `as_matrix` and `as_matrix.cor_df` is now an optional argument rather than set to `1` by default [#52](https://github.com/tidymodels/corrr/issues/52)

## New Functions

- `as_cordf` will coerce lists or matrices into correlation data frames if possible.
- `focus_if` enables conditional variable selection.

## New Functionality

- Can use arithmetic operators (e.g., `+` or `-`) with correlation data frames.
- Plotting functions (`rplot` and `network_plot`) will attempt to coerce objects to a correlation data frame (via `as_cordf`) if needed, making it possible to directly use these functions with other square-matrix-like objects.
- `repel` option added to `network_plot` (default = `TRUE`).
- `curved` option added to `network_plot` (default = `TRUE`).
- `correlate()` now prints a message about the `method` and `use` parameters. Can be silenced with `quiet = TRUE`.
- `correlate()` now supports data frame with a SQL back-end (`tbl_sql`)

## Fixes

- When `legend = TRUE` (now the default setting), `rplot` and `network_plot` generate a single, unlabeled legend referring to the size of the correlations.

## Other

- `correlate()` is now an S3 method so that it can adapt to `x`'s object type.

- During the development of this version, ggplot v2.2.0 was released. Many changes in the plotting functions have been made to handle new features in the updated version of ggplot2.

- Improvements to the package folder structure

# corrr 0.2.1

## New Functionality

- Can keep leading zeros when using `fashion()` with new argument `leading_zeros = TRUE`.
- New optional arguments added to plotting functions, `network_plot()` and `rplot()`:
  - `legend` to display a legend mapping correlations to size and colour.
  - `colours` (or `colors`) to change colours in plot.

## Fixes

- `network_plot()` no longer plots wrong colours if only positive correlations are included.
- Colour scheme for `network_plot()` changed to match `rplot()`.
- Other bug fixes.

# corrr 0.2.0

## New Functions

- `network_plot()` the correlations.
- `focus_()` for standard evaluation version of `focus()`.

## New Functionality

- `fashion()` will now attempt to work on any object (not just `cor_df`), making it useful for printing any data frame, matrix, vector, etc.
- `print_cor` argument added to `rplot()` to overlay the correlations as text.

## Other

- `na_omit` argument in `stretch()` changed to `na.rm` to match `gather_()`.
- Bug fixes.
- Improvements.

# corrr 0.1.0

- First corrr release!
